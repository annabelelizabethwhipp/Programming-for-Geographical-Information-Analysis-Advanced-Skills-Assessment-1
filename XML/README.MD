# XML

This script validates the scheme of an XML file, edits the file and then transforms the file to HTML

The model will print:

True if the XML document follows the input schema

False if the XML document does not follow the input schema

The script will then write a HTML file using the XML input map


Four files are needed in order to run the script successfully:

1. XML maps: map1.xml and map2.xml

2. map2.xsd which is a schema definition document 

3. map1.dtd which is a document type definition document 

4. map3.xsl which is a style sheet
